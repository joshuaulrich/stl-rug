Big data in sports provide a unique and challenging opportunity for advanced statistical analysis and creative data exploration. Extensive data are being collected on athletes, teams, and their opponents. These data are being used in many ways, from individual player evaluation to assisting in strategy development.

This month, I will demonstrate two examples on public datasets. First, the MLB's Statcast dataset will be explored and used to model home run probability as a function a baseball's launch angle and velocity off the bat. Additionally, a package for the analysis of basketball data will be briefly mentioned.

The meetup was recorded, and can be found at the following link:
